## What my program outputs

### C program for master mind logic

Run your C program in unit-testing mode here `./master-mind-terminal -u 121 313` and copy/paste your program's
output here:

```
add program's output here
```

Pick up your specfic input data for doing the unit-testing (see CW spec) and paste the output here"

```
add program's output here
```

Pic your own input and show a complete run of your program in debug mode here `./master-mind-terminal -d`:

```
add program's output here
```

### Assembler program for running and showing the matching code

Use the CPUlator to run your ARM Assembler program and create a screen shot of the result of
running it, with the hex-displays showing the result of the matching function.
Pick up your specfic input data for doing the unit-testing (see CW spec).


## How to run my program

The program will be tested with the provided and with unseen input data 
to ensure that this output above can be reproduced. 
If  you run your compiled executable in a different way
that is stated in the coursework sheet, please state the commands to
compile and run below (or state "not applicable"):
